Liquor and Soda

This really isn't that hard, but the details make it better.

1 part liquor, preferably not the good stuff
1 part soda, of whatever is available
ice
1 low-walled glass, or if necessary a solo cup
(optional) a slice of citrus

Fill cup with ice. Add liquor and soda. If you feel like being fancy, place
citrus slice on the rim of the cup.

Suggested combinations:

whisky and cola
whisky and Dr. Pepper
whisky and lemon-lime soda
rum and cola
rum and Dr. Pepper
