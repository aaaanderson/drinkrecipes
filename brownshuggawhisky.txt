2 parts whisky, preferably something decent
1 part brown sugar syrup
a few cubes of ice
a low-walled glass

To prepare the brown sugar syrup, simply prepare simple syrup, substituting
ordinary brown sugar for the white sugar. Use the brown sugar syrup at room
temperature.

Add whisky to glass. Add syrup and ice. Drink before all of the ice melts.
